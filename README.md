## Usage
Of course, you could clone this repo and build/run from source with your favorite IDE, but go ahead
and check the `releases` tab on the side of this page to download either the `.jar` file
or a native windows executable (`.exe`)

## Features

- Compare up to 9 sorting algorithms at once! (Powered by multithreading)
- 8 sorting algorithms to choose, from the well known bubble sort to a more complex one like radix sort.
- Option to change the speed of the sorting algorithms (in ms), a start and stop button, and the option
to go back to the main menu to pick different sorting algorithms. (Caveat: if you start and stop in the middle of a run
, the algorithm doesn't pick up where it left off, it sorts the existing data like it is a brand new input.)
